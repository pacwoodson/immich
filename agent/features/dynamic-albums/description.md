This project already does a lot of things I need, but it miss one major feature for me.

The project has an "Albums" feature, where users can create albums and add photos to them.
The project has an "Tags" feature, where users add tags to pictures and see all pictures that contains them.

I am heavily relying on tags, and I would like to share albums based on them, instead of having to manually having to add pictures to albums. 

I want to add a "dynamic albums" feature, where users can create albums based on tags. When creating an album, the user can select a list of tags, and the album will be populated with all pictures that contains this tag. 
The pictures in the albums should not be stored in the database, but dynamically fetched from the database. Everytime a dynamic album is displayed, it should show an updated list of the pictures that contains the tags that were used to create the album.
