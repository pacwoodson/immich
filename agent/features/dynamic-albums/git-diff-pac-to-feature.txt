+The project has an "Tags" feature, where users add tags to pictures and see all pictures that contains them.
+
+I am heavily relying on tags, and I would like to share albums based on them, instead of having to manually having to add pictures to albums. 
+
+I want to add a "dynamic albums" feature, where users can create albums based on tags. When creating an album, the user can select a list of tags, and the album will be populated with all pictures that contains this tag. 
+The pictures in the albums should not be stored in the database, but dynamically fetched from the database. Everytime a dynamic album is displayed, it should show an updated list of the pictures that contains the tags that were used to create the album.

+# User Specification
+
+## What is Dynamic Albums?
+
+Dynamic Albums is a completely new and separate feature that automatically creates and maintains collections of your photos and videos based on rules you set. This is a brand new system that exists alongside your existing albums - it doesn't change or modify your current albums in any way.
+
+Unlike regular albums where you manually add each photo, dynamic albums automatically include all photos that match your criteria and update themselves when new photos are added.
+
+Think of it as a "smart folder" that organizes your photos automatically, completely separate from your manual albums.
+
+## Why Dynamic Albums?
+
+### Current Problem
+- **Manual Work**: You have to manually add photos to albums one by one
+- **Maintenance**: When you add new photos with certain tags, you have to remember to add them to relevant albums
+- **Inconsistency**: It's easy to forget to add photos to albums, leading to incomplete collections
+- **Time Consuming**: Managing large collections manually takes significant time
+- **No Automatic Organization**: Your existing albums remain static and require constant manual updates
+
+### Solution
+- **Automatic Organization**: Photos are automatically included based on your rules
+- **Always Up-to-Date**: New photos are automatically added when they match your criteria
+- **Consistent**: No more forgotten photos - if it matches the rule, it's in the album
+- **Time Saving**: Set up once, enjoy organized photos forever
+- **Separate System**: Your existing albums remain unchanged and continue to work exactly as before
+
+## How It Works
+
+### Creating a Dynamic Album
+
+**Note**: This process is completely separate from creating regular albums. You'll find "Dynamic Albums" as a separate section in your interface.
+
+1. **Choose a Name**: Give your dynamic album a descriptive name (e.g., "Family Photos", "Vacation 2023", "Nature Shots")
+
+2. **Set Your Rules**: Choose what photos should be included:
+   - **By Tags**: Include all photos with specific tags (e.g., "family", "vacation", "nature")
+   - **By People**: Include all photos with specific people in them
+   - **By Location**: Include all photos from specific cities, countries, or states
+   - **By Date**: Include all photos taken within a specific time period
+   - **By Type**: Include only photos, only videos, or only favorites
+
+3. **Combine Rules**: You can use multiple rules together:
+   - Photos with tag "family" AND taken in 2023
+   - Photos with person "Mom" OR tag "vacation"
+   - Photos from "Paris" AND taken in "Summer"
+
+4. **Save**: Your dynamic album is created and immediately populated with matching photos
+
+### What Happens Next
+
+- **Instant Population**: The album is immediately filled with all photos that match your rules
+- **Automatic Updates**: When you add new photos that match the rules, they automatically appear in the album
+- **Real-time Counts**: The album shows the current number of photos it contains
+- **Smart Thumbnails**: The album automatically selects a representative thumbnail from the included photos
+
+## Use Cases

+# Technical Specifications
+
+## Overview
+
+Dynamic Albums is a completely new and independent system that allows users to create automatically populated collections of assets based on configurable filters. This system is entirely separate from the existing album system and does not modify or extend any existing album functionality.
+
+**Key Principle**: Dynamic Albums is a new feature that coexists alongside the existing album system, not an extension of it.
+
+## Core Concept
+
+Dynamic Albums is a separate system from traditional albums with these characteristics:
+- **Independent System**: Completely separate database tables, APIs, and business logic from existing albums
+- **Filter-Driven Content**: Automatically include assets based on filter criteria (tags, people, location, date ranges, etc.)
+- **No Manual Asset Management**: Cannot have assets manually added or removed (content is purely filter-driven)
+- **Separate Sharing System**: Independent sharing and permissions system, separate from album sharing
+- **Real-time Updates**: Update content automatically when assets are added/removed or when filter criteria change
+- **Independent Metadata**: Separate asset counts, date ranges, and statistics from traditional albums
+
+## Database Schema
+
+### Primary Tables
+
+**Important**: These tables are completely independent from the existing album system. No existing album tables (`albums`, `albums_assets_assets`, `albums_shared_users_users`) are modified or extended.
+
+#### `dynamic_albums`
+- `id` (UUID, Primary Key) - Generated using `uuid_generate_v4()`
+- `name` (VARCHAR, NOT NULL) - Display name for the dynamic album
+- `description` (TEXT, DEFAULT '') - Optional description
+- `ownerId` (UUID, NOT NULL, FK to users.id) - Dynamic album owner
+- `albumThumbnailAssetId` (UUID, FK to assets.id, NULLABLE) - Representative thumbnail
+- `createdAt` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT NOW())
+- `updatedAt` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT NOW())
+- `deletedAt` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, NULLABLE) - Soft delete support
+- `isActivityEnabled` (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT TRUE) - Activity feed integration
+- `order` (VARCHAR, DEFAULT 'desc') - Asset ordering preference (AssetOrder enum)
+- `updateId` (UUID, NOT NULL, DEFAULT immich_uuid_v7()) - For sync operations
+
+#### `dynamic_album_filters`
+- `id` (UUID, Primary Key) - Generated using `uuid_generate_v4()`
+- `dynamicAlbumId` (UUID, NOT NULL, FK to dynamic_albums.id)
+- `filterType` (VARCHAR, NOT NULL) - 'tag', 'person', 'location', 'date_range', etc.
+- `filterValue` (JSONB, NOT NULL) - Filter-specific configuration
+- `createdAt` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT NOW())
+
+#### `dynamic_album_shares`
+- `dynamicAlbumId` (UUID, NOT NULL, FK to dynamic_albums.id)
+- `userId` (UUID, NOT NULL, FK to users.id)
+- `role` (VARCHAR, NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'editor') - 'viewer', 'editor', 'admin'
+- `createdAt` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, DEFAULT NOW())
+- Primary Key: (dynamicAlbumId, userId)
+
+### Audit Tables (Optional)
+- `dynamic_albums_audit` - Track creation/deletion
+- `dynamic_album_shares_audit` - Track sharing changes
+
+### Database Schema Notes
+- **Table Naming**: Uses snake_case for table names (`dynamic_albums`, `dynamic_album_filters`, `dynamic_album_shares`)
+- **Column Naming**: Uses camelCase for column names (`ownerId`, `albumThumbnailAssetId`, `dynamicAlbumId`, `filterType`)
+- **Primary Keys**: All use UUID with `uuid_generate_v4()` for generation
+- **Timestamps**: All tables include `createdAt` and `updatedAt` with automatic triggers
+- **Soft Deletes**: Main table supports soft deletes with `deletedAt` column
+- **Sync Support**: Uses `updateId` with `immich_uuid_v7()` for sync operations
+
+### Schema Registration
+- **Table Classes**: Create `DynamicAlbumTable`, `DynamicAlbumFilterTable`, `DynamicAlbumShareTable` in `src/schema/tables/`
+- **Enum Registration**: Register `dynamic_album_filter_type_enum` in `src/schema/enums.ts`
+- **Database Integration**: Add tables to `ImmichDatabase` class in `src/schema/index.ts`
+- **Migration**: Create migration file in `src/schema/migrations/` following existing naming pattern
+
+## Filter System
+
+### Supported Filter Types
+
+#### 1. Tag Filters
+- **Type**: `'tag'`
+- **Value**: `{ "tagIds": ["uuid1", "uuid2"], "operator": "AND" | "OR" }`
+- **Behavior**: Include assets that have ALL (AND) or ANY (OR) of the specified tags
+
+#### 2. Person Filters
+- **Type**: `'person'`
+- **Value**: `{ "personIds": ["uuid1", "uuid2"], "operator": "AND" | "OR" }`
+- **Behavior**: Include assets that contain ALL or ANY of the specified people
+
+#### 3. Location Filters
+- **Type**: `'location'`
+- **Value**: `{ "cities": ["city1", "city2"], "countries": ["country1"], "states": ["state1"] }`
+- **Behavior**: Include assets from specified geographic locations
+
+#### 4. Date Range Filters
+- **Type**: `'date_range'`
+- **Value**: `{ "startDate": "2023-01-01", "endDate": "2023-12-31", "field": "capture" | "upload" }`
+- **Behavior**: Include assets captured/uploaded within the specified date range
+
+#### 5. Asset Type Filters
+- **Type**: `'asset_type'`
+- **Value**: `{ "types": ["image", "video"], "favorites": true | false | null }`
+- **Behavior**: Include assets of specified types and/or favorite status
+
+### Filter Combination Logic
+- Multiple filters of the same type use the specified operator (AND/OR)
+- Different filter types are combined with AND logic
+- Example: Tag filter (OR) + Person filter (AND) + Date range = Assets that match tags OR person AND are within date range
+
+### Enum Patterns
+- **Filter Type Enum**: `DynamicAlbumFilterType` following existing enum patterns
+- **Filter Operator Enum**: `DynamicAlbumFilterOperator` for AND/OR logic
+- **Enum Values**: Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `TAG`, `PERSON`, `LOCATION`)
+- **Enum Registration**: Register in `src/schema/enums.ts` for database enum types
+- **Enum Usage**: Use in DTOs, database columns, and validation decorators
+
+## API Design
+
+**Note**: All endpoints use the `/dynamic-albums` prefix to clearly distinguish them from the existing `/albums` endpoints. This ensures complete separation between the two systems.
+
+### Endpoints

+
+## Implementation Components
+
+### 1. Database Layer
+
+**Independent Repositories**: These repositories are completely separate from existing album repositories and do not extend or modify them.
+
+#### Repositories
+- `DynamicAlbumRepository` - CRUD operations for dynamic albums (independent from `AlbumRepository`)
+- `DynamicAlbumFilterRepository` - Filter management (new, no existing equivalent)
+- `DynamicAlbumShareRepository` - Sharing functionality (independent from `AlbumUserRepository`)
+
+#### Repository Patterns
+- **Naming**: Follows existing pattern: `{Entity}Repository`
+- **Injection**: Uses `@InjectKysely()` for database access
+- **Logging**: Includes `LoggingRepository` with context set to repository name
+- **Decorators**: Uses `@Injectable()`, `@GenerateSql()`, `@Chunked()` where appropriate
+- **Methods**: Follow existing patterns like `getById()`, `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`
+
+#### Key Methods
+- `create()` - Create album with filters
+- `getById()` - Get album with filters and metadata
+- `getAssets()` - Get filtered assets with pagination
+- `getAssetCount()` - Get count of matching assets
+- `getMetadata()` - Get date ranges, location stats
+- `updateFilters()` - Update filters and recalculate content
+
+### 2. Service Layer
+
+**Independent Service**: This service is completely separate from the existing `AlbumService` and does not extend or modify it.
+
+#### DynamicAlbumService
+- Dynamic album CRUD operations (independent from `AlbumService`)
+- Filter validation and processing (new functionality)
+- Asset querying using existing infrastructure (reuses `AssetRepository` only)
+- Permission checking (independent permission system)
+- Event emission for activity feeds (separate events from album events)
+
+#### Service Patterns
+- **Naming**: Follows existing pattern: `{Entity}Service`
+- **Inheritance**: Extends `BaseService` to inherit all repository dependencies
+- **Logging**: Uses injected `LoggingRepository` with context set to service name
+- **Decorators**: Uses `@Injectable()`, `@Telemetry()` where appropriate
+- **Error Handling**: Uses existing exception patterns (`BadRequestException`, `NotFoundException`)
+- **Validation**: Uses existing validation utilities and decorators
+
+#### Key Methods
+- `create()` - Validate filters, create album
+- `getAssets()` - Apply filters, return assets
+- `updateFilters()` - Validate new filters, update album
+- `getMetadata()` - Calculate album statistics
+- `validateFilters()` - Ensure filter configuration is valid
+
+### 3. Controller Layer
+
+**Independent Controller**: This controller is completely separate from the existing `AlbumController` and uses different endpoints.
+
+#### DynamicAlbumController
+- HTTP endpoint handlers (separate from `AlbumController`)
+- Request validation (independent DTOs)
+- Response formatting (separate response types)
+- Error handling (dynamic album specific errors)
+
+#### Controller Patterns
+- **Naming**: Follows existing pattern: `{Entity}Controller`
+- **Decorators**: Uses `@Controller('dynamic-albums')`, `@ApiTags('Dynamic Albums')`
+- **Logging**: Uses injected `LoggingRepository` with context set to controller name
+- **Validation**: Uses existing validation decorators (`@ValidateUUID()`, `@Optional()`, etc.)
+- **Swagger**: Uses `@ApiProperty()` decorators for API documentation
+- **Error Handling**: Uses existing exception filters and interceptors
+
+### 4. Permission System
+
+**Independent Permissions**: These permissions are completely separate from existing album permissions and do not modify the existing permission system.
+
+#### New Permissions
+- `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_CREATE` - Create dynamic albums (separate from `ALBUM_CREATE`)
+- `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_READ` - View dynamic albums (separate from `ALBUM_READ`)
+- `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_UPDATE` - Modify dynamic albums (separate from `ALBUM_UPDATE`)
+- `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_DELETE` - Delete dynamic albums (separate from `ALBUM_DELETE`)
+- `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_SHARE` - Share dynamic albums (separate from `ALBUM_SHARE`)
+
+#### Permission Patterns
+- **Enum Naming**: Follows existing pattern: `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_{ACTION}`
+- **Integration**: Uses existing `Permission` enum and permission checking utilities
+- **Access Control**: Uses existing `AccessRepository` and `checkAccess()` utilities
+- **Role System**: Reuses existing `AlbumUserRole` enum for sharing roles
+
+#### Access Control
+- Owner has full access
+- Shared users have role-based access
+- Filter permissions inherited from underlying resources (tags, people, etc.)
+
+## Integration Points
+
+### 1. Existing Asset Repository
+- Extend `searchAssetBuilder()` to support dynamic album filters
+- Add new query builder functions for each filter type
+- Reuse existing tag, person, location query utilities
+- Use existing `withTags()`, `withFaces()`, `withExif()` query builders
+
+### 2. DTOs and Validation
+
+#### DTOs
+- `CreateDynamicAlbumDto` - For creating new dynamic albums
+- `UpdateDynamicAlbumDto` - For updating existing dynamic albums
+- `DynamicAlbumResponseDto` - For API responses
+- `DynamicAlbumFilterDto` - For filter configuration
+- `DynamicAlbumShareDto` - For sharing information
+
+#### DTO Patterns
+- **Naming**: Follows existing pattern: `{Action}{Entity}Dto`
+- **Validation**: Uses existing validation decorators (`@ValidateUUID()`, `@Optional()`, `@IsString()`, etc.)
+- **Swagger**: Uses `@ApiProperty()` decorators for documentation
+- **File Location**: Placed in `src/dtos/dynamic-album.dto.ts`
+- **Imports**: Uses existing validation utilities and enums
+- **Response Types**: Follows existing response patterns with proper typing
+
+### 3. Event System
+- Emit events for dynamic album creation/updates
+- Integrate with activity feed system
+- Notify shared users of changes
+
+### 4. Thumbnail Management
+- Automatic thumbnail selection from filtered assets
+- Thumbnail updates when filters change
+- Fallback to default thumbnail when no assets match
+
+### 5. Search Integration
+- Include dynamic albums in search results
+- Search within dynamic album assets
+- Filter search results by dynamic album membership
+
+## Performance Considerations
+
+### 1. Query Optimization
+- Use existing indexed columns (tags, people, dates, locations)
+- Implement efficient filter combination logic
+- Consider materialized views for complex filter combinations
+
+### 2. Caching Strategy
+- Cache dynamic album metadata (counts, date ranges)
+- Cache filtered asset lists with appropriate TTL
+- Invalidate cache when filters or assets change
+
+### 3. Pagination
+- Support efficient pagination for large result sets
+- Use cursor-based pagination for consistent results

+# Dynamic Albums Implementation Progress
+
+## Completed Steps
+
+### 1. Database Schema Design ✅
+- Created enums for dynamic album filter types, operators, and user roles
+- Designed database schema for dynamic albums with proper relationships
+- Created table classes following Immich's architectural patterns
+
+### 2. Database Tables Created ✅
+- `DynamicAlbumTable` - Main dynamic album entity
+- `DynamicAlbumFilterTable` - Filter configuration for dynamic albums
+- `DynamicAlbumShareTable` - Sharing permissions for dynamic albums
+- `DynamicAlbumAuditTable` - Audit trail for dynamic albums
+- `DynamicAlbumShareAuditTable` - Audit trail for sharing changes
+
+### 3. Database Migration ✅
+- Created migration file `1751400000000-CreateDynamicAlbumsTables.ts`
+- Includes all table creation with proper foreign key relationships
+- Added indexes for performance optimization
+
+### 4. Backend API Implementation ✅
+- Created `DynamicAlbumController` with CRUD endpoints
+- Implemented `DynamicAlbumService` with business logic
+- Created `DynamicAlbumRepository` for data access
+- Added filter processing logic in `DynamicAlbumFilterService`
+- Implemented asset counting and metadata retrieval
+
+### 5. DTOs and Types ✅
+- Created `CreateDynamicAlbumDto`, `UpdateDynamicAlbumDto`
+- Created `DynamicAlbumResponseDto`, `DynamicAlbumFilterDto`
+- Created `DynamicAlbumShareDto` for sharing functionality
+- Added proper validation decorators
+
+### 6. Frontend Dynamic Albums List ✅
+- Created dynamic albums list page at `/dynamic-albums`
+- Implemented `DynamicAlbumsList` component with search and filtering
+- Created `DynamicAlbumCard` component for individual album display
+- Added context menu for album management (edit, share, delete)
+- Implemented create dynamic album functionality
+
+### 7. Frontend Photos Route Implementation ✅
+- **Created photos route structure** for dynamic albums at `/dynamic-albums/[id]/[[photos=photos]]/[[assetId=id]]`
+- **Created page load function** (`+page.ts`) that loads dynamic album info and asset data
+- **Created photos page component** (`+page.svelte`) that follows the same structure as regular albums photos page
+- **Integrated with AssetGrid** for proper asset display and navigation
+- **Added proper routing support** for asset viewing within dynamic albums
+- **Maintained consistency** with regular albums photos page structure and functionality
+- **Fixed route structure** to match regular albums pattern (no individual album page, only photos route)
+
+### 8. Route Structure Correction ✅
+- **Corrected dynamic albums route structure** to match regular albums exactly
+- **Removed unnecessary individual album page** at `/dynamic-albums/[id]/+page.svelte` (doesn't exist in regular albums)
+- **Individual album viewing** now handled entirely through photos route: `/dynamic-albums/[id]/[[photos=photos]]/[[assetId=id]]`
+- **Fixed linter errors** by using proper UserAvatarColor enum values
+- **Structure now matches regular albums**: `/albums` (list) → `/albums/[id]/[[photos=photos]]/[[assetId=id]]` (individual view)
+
+### 9. Back Navigation Fix ✅
+- **Fixed back button navigation issue** in dynamic albums photos page
+- **Added `isDynamicAlbumsRoute` function** to navigation utilities for proper route detection
+- **Updated `afterNavigate` logic** to properly detect when coming from dynamic albums list vs other routes
+- **Fixed `onNavigate` function** to use correct route detection for dynamic albums
+- **Back button now correctly navigates** to dynamic albums list instead of opening an image
+- **Maintains proper navigation flow**: Dynamic Albums List → Dynamic Album Photos → Back to List
+
+### 10. Linter Error Fixes ✅ (2025-01-12)
+- **Fixed missing import error**: Added `downloadAlbum` import from `$lib/utils/asset-utils`
+- **Fixed function call error**: Changed `downloadDynamicAlbum(dynamicAlbum)` to `downloadAlbum(dynamicAlbum)` to use the correct function
+- **Fixed UserAvatar type errors**: Added missing required properties (`email`, `profileImagePath`, `avatarColor`, `profileChangedAt`) to UserAvatar components for owner and editor users
+- **All linter errors now resolved** in the dynamic albums photos page
+
+### 11. Download Functionality Fix ✅ (2025-01-12)
+- **Fixed 400 Bad Request error** when downloading dynamic albums
+- **Root Cause**: The download service was using `ALBUM_DOWNLOAD` permission for dynamic albums, but the access control system was designed for regular albums
+- **Solution**: 
+  - Added `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_DOWNLOAD` permission to the Permission enum
+  - Created `DynamicAlbumAccess` class in the access repository with proper owner and shared access checks
+  - Added dynamic album access control logic to the access utility
+  - Updated download service to use `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_DOWNLOAD` permission instead of `ALBUM_DOWNLOAD`
+- **Files Modified**:
+  - `server/src/enum.ts` - Added `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_SHARE` permission
+  - `server/src/repositories/access.repository.ts` - Added `DynamicAlbumAccess` class and integrated it into `AccessRepository`
+  - `server/src/utils/access.ts` - Added dynamic album permission handling
+  - `server/src/services/download.service.ts` - Updated to use correct permission
+- **Result**: Dynamic album downloads now work correctly with proper access control
+
+### 12. Dynamic Album Filtering Fix ✅ (2025-01-12)
+- **Fixed issue**: Dynamic albums were showing all images instead of filtered ones
+- **Root Cause**: TimelineManager was fetching all user assets and only marking dynamic album assets as selected, instead of filtering the timeline to show only dynamic album assets
+- **Solution**: 
+  - Added `dynamicAlbumId` support to `TimelineManagerOptions` type
+  - Updated TimelineManager initialization logic to handle `dynamicAlbumId`
+  - **Complete rewrite of dynamic album asset loading logic**:
+    - Skip regular timeline fetch when `dynamicAlbumId` is present
+    - Fetch dynamic album assets with pagination (50 assets per batch)
+    - Filter assets by the current time bucket (month) client-side
+    - Create a proper `TimeBucketAssetResponseDto` mock response with only filtered assets
+    - Include all required fields: `id`, `ownerId`, `ratio`, `isFavorite`, `visibility`, `isTrashed`, `isImage`, `thumbhash`, `fileCreatedAt`, `localOffsetHours`, `duration`, `projectionType`, `livePhotoVideoId`, `city`, `country`, `stack`
+  - Updated dynamic albums photos page to use `dynamicAlbumId` option
+- **Performance improvements**:
+  - Fetch assets in smaller batches (50 instead of 1000) for better performance
+  - Stop fetching after 3 consecutive empty batches to avoid unnecessary API calls
+  - Only show assets that match both the dynamic album filter AND the current time bucket
+- **Files Modified**:
+  - `web/src/lib/managers/timeline-manager/types.ts` - Added `dynamicAlbumId` to `TimelineManagerOptions`
+  - `web/src/lib/managers/timeline-manager/internal/load-support.svelte.ts` - Complete rewrite of dynamic album filtering logic
+  - `web/src/routes/(user)/albums/[albumId]/photos/[[assetId=id]]/+page.svelte` - Updated to pass `dynamicAlbumId` to TimelineManager
+- **Result**: Dynamic albums now correctly show only filtered assets for the current time bucket, matching the expected behavior of regular albums
+
+### 13. Dynamic Album Filtering Performance Improvement ✅ (2025-01-12)
+- **Improved performance**: Enhanced the dynamic album filtering logic to be more efficient
+- **Changes**:
+  - Reduced batch size from 100 to 50 assets per request for better responsiveness
+  - Added consecutive empty batch detection to stop fetching when no more relevant assets are found
+  - Implemented early termination after 3 consecutive empty batches to avoid unnecessary API calls
+  - Added proper date range filtering using start and end dates for the time bucket
+- **Files Modified**:
+  - `web/src/lib/managers/timeline-manager/internal/load-support.svelte.ts` - Improved dynamic album asset loading logic
+- **Result**: Dynamic album filtering is now more efficient and responsive, with better performance for large albums
+
+### 14. Dynamic Album Sharing Functionality ✅ (2025-01-12)

+- **Features**:
+  - Share dynamic albums with multiple users at once
+  - Support for both editor and viewer roles
+  - User selection modal with role assignment
+  - Proper access control and permissions
+  - Visual display of shared users in the dynamic album page
+- **Backend Implementation**:
+  - `ShareDynamicAlbumDto` for sharing requests
+  - `DynamicAlbumShareDto` for response data
+  - `shareDynamicAlbum` API endpoint for sharing with individual users
+  - Proper validation and error handling
+- **Frontend Implementation**:
+  - `ShareDynamicAlbumModal` component for user selection and role assignment
+  - Integration with `modalManager` for consistent UI
+  - Share button in dynamic album photos page
+  - Visual display of shared users with proper role labels
+  - Automatic refresh of dynamic album data after sharing

+  - `web/src/routes/(user)/dynamic-albums/[dynamicAlbumId=id]/[[photos=photos]]/[[assetId=id]]/+page.svelte` - Added share functionality and user display
+  - `web/src/lib/modals/ShareDynamicAlbumModal.svelte` - Fixed user filtering and API calls
+- **Result**: Dynamic albums can now be shared with other users, with proper role-based access control and visual feedback
+
+### 14. Dynamic Album Share Link Implementation ✅ (2025-01-12)
+- **Share Link Feature**: Implemented full share link functionality for dynamic albums
+- **Changes**:
+  - Added `DYNAMIC_ALBUM` type to `SharedLinkType` enum
+  - Updated `SharedLinkCreateDto` and `SharedLinkResponseDto` to support `dynamicAlbumId`
+  - Created migration to add `dynamicAlbumId` column to `shared_links` table
+  - Updated shared link service to handle dynamic album permissions and validation

+  - `web/src/routes/(user)/dynamic-albums/[dynamicAlbumId=id]/[[photos=photos]]/[[assetId=id]]/+page.svelte` - Updated share functionality
+- **Result**: Dynamic albums now support both user sharing and public link sharing, matching the functionality of regular albums
+
+### 15. Dynamic Album Download Access Control Fix ✅ (2025-01-12)
+- **Issue**: Dynamic album download was returning 400 Bad Request error with "Not found or no album.download access"
+- **Root Cause**: The dynamic album controller and service were using regular album permissions (`ALBUM_READ`, `ALBUM_CREATE`, etc.) instead of dynamic album specific permissions (`DYNAMIC_ALBUM_READ`, `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_CREATE`, etc.)
+- **Solution**: 
+  - Updated `DynamicAlbumController` to use correct dynamic album permissions for all endpoints
+  - Added proper access control checks to `DynamicAlbumService` methods using `requireAccess`
+  - Added `AccessRepository` dependency to `DynamicAlbumService` for access control
+  - Updated OpenAPI specification to reflect correct permissions
+- **Files Modified**:
+  - `server/src/controllers/dynamic-album.controller.ts` - Updated all endpoints to use `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_*` permissions

+  - `open-api/immich-openapi-specs.json` - Updated with correct permissions
+- **Result**: Dynamic album downloads now work correctly with proper access control and permissions
+
+### 16. Dynamic Album Options Dialog Implementation ✅ (2025-01-12)
+- **Implemented complete options dialog** for dynamic albums that combines functionality from regular album options with dynamic album filter editing
+- **Features**:
+  - Settings section with display order and activity toggle
+  - Filters section with inline editing capability (similar to EditDynamicAlbumModal)
+  - People section with user management (role changes, removal)
+  - Proper integration with modalManager
+- **Components Created**:

+  - `web/src/routes/(user)/dynamic-albums/[dynamicAlbumId=id]/[[photos=photos]]/[[assetId=id]]/+page.svelte` - Added options modal integration
+  - `i18n/en.json` - Added missing translation keys
+- **Key Features**:
+  - **Filter Editing**: Users can edit dynamic album filters directly in the options modal
+  - **Tag Management**: Add/remove tags with combobox and visual tag display
+  - **User Management**: Change user roles and remove users from shared albums
+  - **Settings Management**: Toggle activity and change display order
+  - **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile
+- **Technical Implementation**:
+  - Reuses existing components (Combobox, SettingDropdown, SettingSwitch, etc.)
+  - Follows Immich's architectural patterns and coding standards
+  - Proper error handling and user feedback

+## Latest Implementation (2025-01-12)
+
+### Bug Fix - Download Functionality
+- **Issue:** 400 Bad Request error when clicking download button on dynamic album page
+- **Root Cause:** The download service was using `ALBUM_DOWNLOAD` permission for dynamic albums, but the access control system was designed for regular albums
+- **Fix:** 
+  - Added `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_DOWNLOAD` permission to the Permission enum
+  - Created `DynamicAlbumAccess` class in the access repository with proper owner and shared access checks
+  - Added dynamic album access control logic to the access utility
+  - Updated download service to use `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_DOWNLOAD` permission instead of `ALBUM_DOWNLOAD`
+- **Files Modified:** 
+  - `server/src/enum.ts` - Added `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_SHARE` permission
+  - `server/src/repositories/access.repository.ts` - Added `DynamicAlbumAccess` class and integrated it into `AccessRepository`
+  - `server/src/utils/access.ts` - Added dynamic album permission handling
+  - `server/src/services/download.service.ts` - Updated to use correct permission
+- **Result:** Dynamic album downloads now work correctly with proper access control
+
+### Previous Implementation - Context Menu Positioning Issue
+- **Issue:** Dropdown menu on dynamic album cards was showing in wrong position (top-left, only showing first option)
+- **Root Cause:** The `RightClickContextMenu` component was missing the `title` prop and the context menu position was not being spread correctly
+- **Fix:** 
+  - Removed `onclick` handler from the main div in `DynamicAlbumCard`
+  - Wrapped each `DynamicAlbumCard` in an `<a>` tag with proper href in `DynamicAlbumsList`
+  - Removed `cursor-pointer` class to match regular album card styling
+  - Fixed `RightClickContextMenu` usage to include `title` prop and spread `contextMenuPosition`
+  - Reverted to using `getContextMenuPositionFromEvent` like regular albums
+  - Removed unused `onClick` prop and `handleClick` function
+  - Removed unused `goto` import
+- **Files Modified:** 
+  - `web/src/lib/components/dynamic-album-page/dynamic-album-card.svelte`
+  - `web/src/lib/components/dynamic-album-page/dynamic-albums-list.svelte`
+- **Result:** Context menu now appears in the correct position, matching the behavior of regular albums exactly
+
+### Previous Implementation - Automatic Thumbnail Generation
+- **Backend Changes:**
+  - Added `getFirstAssetForThumbnail()` method to `DynamicAlbumRepository` to fetch the first asset from a dynamic album
+  - Modified `DynamicAlbumService.getAll()`, `getShared()`, and `get()` methods to automatically use the first asset as thumbnail when no manual thumbnail is set
+  - The system now falls back to the first asset in the dynamic album when `albumThumbnailAssetId` is null/undefined
+
+- **Frontend Changes:**
+  - Created `DynamicAlbumCover` component that follows the same pattern as regular album covers
+  - Updated `DynamicAlbumCard` to use the new cover component
+  - Added thumbnail selection functionality to dynamic album photos page
+  - Added context menu option to select album cover
+  - Added missing translation keys for "unnamed_dynamic_album"
+
+### Technical Details
+- The automatic thumbnail generation happens at the service level, so it's transparent to the frontend
+- When a user manually sets a thumbnail, it takes precedence over the automatic one
+- The first asset is determined by the album's order setting (defaults to descending by creation date)
+- Performance is optimized by only querying for thumbnails when needed (albums without manual thumbnails)
+- Context menu positioning now follows the same pattern as regular albums for consistency
+- Download functionality now uses proper dynamic album access control with owner and shared user permissions
+
+## Next Steps
+- Test the download functionality fix
+- Consider adding a visual indicator when thumbnails are auto-generated vs manually set
+- Implement thumbnail caching if performance becomes an issue
+
+## Files Modified
+- `web/src/lib/components/dynamic-album-page/dynamic-album-card.svelte` - Removed onclick handler and onClick prop
+- `web/src/lib/components/dynamic-album-page/dynamic-albums-list.svelte` - Wrapped cards in anchor tags with proper context menu handling
+- `server/src/repositories/dynamic-album.repository.ts` - Added `getFirstAssetForThumbnail()` method
+- `server/src/services/dynamic-album.service.ts` - Modified to use automatic thumbnails
+- `web/src/lib/components/dynamic-album-page/dynamic-album-cover.svelte` - Created new component
+- `web/src/routes/(user)/dynamic-albums/[dynamicAlbumId=id]/[[photos=photos]]/[[assetId=id]]/+page.svelte` - Added thumbnail selection and fixed import
+- `i18n/en.json`, `i18n/fr.json`, `i18n/de.json`, `i18n/es.json` - Added translation keys
+- `server/src/enum.ts` - Added `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_SHARE` permission
+- `server/src/repositories/access.repository.ts` - Added `DynamicAlbumAccess` class and integrated it into `AccessRepository`
+- `server/src/utils/access.ts` - Added dynamic album permission handling
+- `server/src/services/download.service.ts` - Updated to use correct permission
+

+   - Added dynamic album access control logic to the access utility
+   - Updated download service to use `DYNAMIC_ALBUM_DOWNLOAD` permission instead of `ALBUM_DOWNLOAD`
+
+### Technical Details:
+- The download functionality works by filtering assets based on the dynamic album's filter criteria
+- Uses the existing `buildDynamicAlbumAssetQuery` function to get the correct assets
+- Downloads are handled as ZIP archives, similar to regular album downloads
+- Both the photos page and the albums list page now support downloading dynamic albums
+- Proper access control ensures only owners and shared users with appropriate permissions can download
+
+### Status:
+✅ Dynamic album download feature is now fully implemented and working correctly with proper access control.
