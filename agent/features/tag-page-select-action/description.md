Most of the app's pages allows to select multiple photos and execute actions on them, like the photos, folder and albums page.

The tags page does enable selecting multiple photos, but there is no action bar appearing when a selection is active.

Add this AssetSelectControlBar to the tags page, add the common actions we can do on photos, and add a button to remove the currently selected tag to the selected photos.
