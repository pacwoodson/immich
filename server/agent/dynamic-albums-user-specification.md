# Dynamic Albums - User Specification

## What is Dynamic Albums?

Dynamic Albums is a completely new and separate feature that automatically creates and maintains collections of your photos and videos based on rules you set. This is a brand new system that exists alongside your existing albums - it doesn't change or modify your current albums in any way.

Unlike regular albums where you manually add each photo, dynamic albums automatically include all photos that match your criteria and update themselves when new photos are added.

Think of it as a "smart folder" that organizes your photos automatically, completely separate from your manual albums.

## Why Dynamic Albums?

### Current Problem
- **Manual Work**: You have to manually add photos to albums one by one
- **Maintenance**: When you add new photos with certain tags, you have to remember to add them to relevant albums
- **Inconsistency**: It's easy to forget to add photos to albums, leading to incomplete collections
- **Time Consuming**: Managing large collections manually takes significant time
- **No Automatic Organization**: Your existing albums remain static and require constant manual updates

### Solution
- **Automatic Organization**: Photos are automatically included based on your rules
- **Always Up-to-Date**: New photos are automatically added when they match your criteria
- **Consistent**: No more forgotten photos - if it matches the rule, it's in the album
- **Time Saving**: Set up once, enjoy organized photos forever
- **Separate System**: Your existing albums remain unchanged and continue to work exactly as before

## How It Works

### Creating a Dynamic Album

**Note**: This process is completely separate from creating regular albums. You'll find "Dynamic Albums" as a separate section in your interface.

1. **Choose a Name**: Give your dynamic album a descriptive name (e.g., "Family Photos", "Vacation 2023", "Nature Shots")

2. **Set Your Rules**: Choose what photos should be included:
   - **By Tags**: Include all photos with specific tags (e.g., "family", "vacation", "nature")
   - **By People**: Include all photos with specific people in them
   - **By Location**: Include all photos from specific cities, countries, or states
   - **By Date**: Include all photos taken within a specific time period
   - **By Type**: Include only photos, only videos, or only favorites

3. **Combine Rules**: You can use multiple rules together:
   - Photos with tag "family" AND taken in 2023
   - Photos with person "Mom" OR tag "vacation"
   - Photos from "Paris" AND taken in "Summer"

4. **Save**: Your dynamic album is created and immediately populated with matching photos

### What Happens Next

- **Instant Population**: The album is immediately filled with all photos that match your rules
- **Automatic Updates**: When you add new photos that match the rules, they automatically appear in the album
- **Real-time Counts**: The album shows the current number of photos it contains
- **Smart Thumbnails**: The album automatically selects a representative thumbnail from the included photos
