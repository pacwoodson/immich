Here is a list of actions a supervisor can ask or you can execute if you need:


# Pack the code

You can pack a summary of the code in a markdown file with repomix, with executing the following example command, that you have to adapt to the current project:

- `npx repomix@latest ./src -o ./agent/code-packs/src.md`

# Analyse current state of the code

- Analyse what files have been changed: `git diff main --name-only`
- For each file, read the diff from the main branch and analyse what has been done
- In `./agent/features/[feature_name]/status.md`, write:
  - What files have been changed
  - What have been done
  - What problems have been detected
  - What needs to be done

# Initiating a feature branch

- Create a branch with the name like `feature/[feature_name]`
- Read the feature description in `./agent/features/[feature_name]/description.md` file or write it yourself if you know what the feature is about. 
- Write a specification of the feature in `./agent/features/[feature_name]/specs.md` file from the description. Start with a clear user specification, and then a technical specification.
- Update the code package in ./agent/code-packs with repomix

# Prepare for merging a feature

When the feature is complete and ready to be merged:

- Analyse the current state of the code so we get an up to date `./agent/features/[feature_name]/status.md` file.
- Pack the code.
- Create the pull request with a great description
